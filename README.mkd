The goal here is to make a puzzle server. Puzzles are published. You write
code, and push your code to the puzzle server. The server runs your code,
and compares the output to the puzzle. If you have good output, you win and get points. Otherwise you don't win, and don't get points.

Status:

* [x] Recieve git pushes
* [x] Run Dockerfiles
* [ ] Do anything with the output
* [ ] Puzzle checker
* [ ] Points
* [ ] Web UI
